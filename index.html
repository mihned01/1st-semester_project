      <h2 class="section-heading">A hopeful journey through plastic</h2>
      <p class="intro-text">
        The inspiration for the animation below came from a song whose lyrics deeply resonate with us: 
        <br><br>
        “I crawled onto an island made of plastics. Where every life is condemned to be undone. Take me back to where it all once started.”
        <br><br>
        The lyrics speak to the devastation caused by plastic, but also to the desire to undo the damage and return to a cleaner, healthier world. 
        The animation shows the harm caused to marine life and ecosystems. But it doesn't stop there. 
        There is hope: the healing power of nature when we choose to act. 
        <br><br>
        It's a reminder that together, we can turn the tide on plastic pollution. 
        Join by supporting the Global Plastic Treaty, a global solution for cleaner oceans, thriving ecosystems, and a future free of plastic waste.

            <strong>The problem:</strong>
           <br><br>
           Every year, over 11 million tons of plastic enter our oceans, polluting marine ecosystems and threatening wildlife. Seals, like many marine animals, suffer from this crisis often becoming entangled in plastic waste or mistaking it for food, which can lead to starvation or death. Shockingly, traces of microplastics have even been found in fish, whales but also in human blood and mother’s milk, showing the far-reaching effects of this pollution.
